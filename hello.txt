Weâ€™ve developed a standalone Java application as a common library and integrated it with a pipeline that includes a Maven build stage.

Now, we need to add another stage to the pipeline where the JAR file from the target folder will be uploaded to Artifactory as a Maven package. This will allow us to use the library as a Maven dependency in other APIs and services.

Could you please assist us in configuring the pipeline to push the JAR file as a Maven package to Artifactory? Let me know if you need any additional details or access.

Thanks in advance for your support!
